REaSoN
======

This branch persists the node.js version of the program. It is currently orphaned but still contains some data that might be relevant for the new client-only version.


Setup
=====

To set the project up simply clone it, install node.js and the necessary npm modules, and populate an apop_data directory correctly (documentation to be added).

To install the npm modules if node.js and npm are installed, just type

    npm install
